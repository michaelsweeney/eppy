Installation
============

Type the following at your terminal to install **eppy**

::

	pip install eppy

.. Go to http://www.numpy.org and install NumPy.

.. I have disabled the install of NumPy through "pip install eppy", since it was not reliable

For additional functionality:

- Go to  http://www.graphviz.org and install graphviz
- This is needed to draw loop diagrams.
- The rest of eppy will work without graphviz

*Note: eppy runs on python2 and python 3.*

Running eppy on other platforms
-------------------------------

Eppy on Grasshopper (for use within Rhino)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `CPython plugin for Rhino-Grasshopper <https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelRahman/GH_CPython>`_ to run eppy in `Grasshopper <http://www.grasshopper3d.com/>`_
