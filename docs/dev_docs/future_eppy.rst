The Future of eppy
==================

The future of eppy lies in the use of eppy to build a more comprehensive tool kit to work with Energyplus models. In a sense eppy should not grow much at all. Eppy should become more effective as tool kit at a very granular level. 

Longterm TODOs for eppy
-----------------------

Some of the possibilities for the future growth of eppy are:

- A geometry builder for Energyplus. The open source 3-D software Blender has a python scripting language. One possibility would be to use Blender as a geometry interface for eppy and Energyplus
- A HVAC Builder for Energyplus. 
- A HVAC diagram tool for Energyplus. Eppy has a reasonbly good diagram tool for HVAC network. Right now it shows a purely static image of the network. An enhancement of this would be to ability to edit the network through the diagram
- A User interface for Energyplus. This may be redundant, since the present IDF editor is quite good. 
- A web based user interface Energyplus. The path of least resistance to do this would be to a python web framework like django, flask, pyramid or bottle. Bottle is a very light weight web framework and could be used to make small special purpose interfaces for Energyplus.

The eppy project will take a lead on some of these projects. Working on these projects will feed back information into eppy, on how to improve the functionality of eppy
